# WhatsAppClone - _UNDER CONSTRUCTION_

A WhatsApp clone project.

This app is a clone version of WhatsApp with Flutter. Real contacts replaced with DialogFlow API small-talk agents

The main goal is to build readble, maintainable, testable, and high-quality flutter project using mvvm design pattern.

The view layer (UI), viewmodel layer (business logic), model layer (services, repos) are all seperated from each other. The view layer can only talks to the viewmodel. The model layer can only talks to the viewmodel layer. The viewmodel layer is the bridge between the layers, and can talks both view layer and model layer.
